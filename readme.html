<h1>Internationalization Thesis</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to build an internationalized website. The website that was built is an interactive map that displays the level of development across each country, and redirects users to relevant donation pages.</p>
<p>The website explores the internationalization features of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The text and styling is loaded based on the language determined by the user’s Browser Language preferences, obtained with the navigator.languages property.</p>
<p>Using the user’s IP address, the coordinates are obtained to identify Browser Region, which is then used to display the user’s location (geolocation), and determine the currency that should be displayed.</p>
<p>The library that is used to display and interact with the map is the Leaflet library, while the map is obtained from Mapbox. The GeoJSON file format is used to add layers that allow interaction with the map.</p>
<p>The Open Exchange Rates API and money.js library are used to convert currencies based on their real time exchange rate.
The ECMAscript Internationalization API is used to format and display numbers in the format determined by Browser Language.</p>
